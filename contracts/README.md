KipuBank - Secure Ether Vault
Overview
KipuBank is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that functions as a secure, decentralized bank vault for Ether (ETH). It allows users to deposit and withdraw funds into their personal balance while enforcing strict security rules and limits.

The contract is designed with a strong focus on security, gas optimization, and clarity, adhering to the latest best practices in Solidity development. Key features include a global deposit cap to limit total exposure and a per-transaction withdrawal limit to mitigate potential losses.

Features
Secure Deposits: Users can deposit ETH into a personal, isolated balance within the contract.
Capped Withdrawals: Withdrawals are limited by a fixed, immutable amount per transaction, set at deployment.
Global Vault Limit: The contract enforces a total BANK_CAP, preventing deposits once the vault's total balance reaches this limit.
Custom Errors: All validations revert with clear, custom errors for a better user and developer experience.
Event Emission: The contract emits Deposit and Withdrawal events for successful transactions, allowing for easy off-chain tracking.
Security First: Implements the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent re-entrancy attacks.
Gas Optimization: Uses unchecked blocks for safe arithmetic operations and minimizes state variable access to reduce transaction costs.
Fully Documented: Comprehensive NatSpec comments for all functions, variables, and events, ensuring full transparency on platforms like Etherscan.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A web browser with an Ethereum wallet extension like MetaMask.
Some test ETH on a network like Sepolia.
Deployment Instructions
The easiest way to deploy this contract is using the Remix IDE.

Open Remix IDE: Navigate to remix.ethereum.org.
Create File: Create a new file named KipuBank.sol and paste the contract code into it.
Compile the Contract:
Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab (third icon on the left).
Select a compiler version compatible with ^0.8.20 (e.g., 0.8.24).
Click the "Compile KipuBank.sol" button. A green checkmark will appear if successful.
Deploy the Contract:
Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (fourth icon on the left).
Under "Environment", select "Injected Provider - MetaMask" and connect your wallet. Make sure you are on the correct test network (e.g., Sepolia).
In the "Contract" dropdown, KipuBank should be selected.
Next to the "Deploy" button, you need to provide the constructor arguments:
_withdrawalLimit: The maximum amount (in wei) allowed per withdrawal. For 0.1 ETH, enter: 100000000000000000.
_bankCap: The total capacity of the bank (in wei). For 10 ETH, enter: 10000000000000000000.
Click the "transact" button and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
Congratulations! Your KipuBank contract is now deployed. You can find its address under the "Deployed Contracts" section in Remix.

Interacting with the Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract's functions directly from the Remix interface.

Depositing Ether (addFunds)
The addFunds function is payable, which means you send ETH along with the transaction.

In Remix, under "Deployed Contracts", find your KipuBank instance.
In the VALUE input field (on the left panel), enter the amount of ETH you wish to deposit and select "Ether" from the dropdown.
Click the orange addFunds button and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
Withdrawing Ether (withdraw)
Find the withdraw function in your deployed contract.
Enter the amount you wish to withdraw (in wei) into the amount input field.
Click the withdraw button and confirm the transaction. The funds will be sent to your wallet.
Viewing Information (Read Functions)
The blue buttons represent view functions, which are free to call as they only read data from the blockchain.

getBalance(address user): Check the balance of any user's address.
checkMyFunds(): A convenience function to check your own balance.
getBankBalance(): View the total ETH currently held by the contract.
getAvailableCapacity(): See how much more ETH can be deposited before the BANK_CAP is reached.
MAX_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT / BANK_CAP: Check the immutable limits set at deployment.
depositCount / totalTransactionsOut: View the total number of deposit and withdrawal transactions.
